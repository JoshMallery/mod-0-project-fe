## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

   - It felt pretty good, I enjoyed looking at the examples and learning and thinking through the problems.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

   - For example a website could have an array of usernames that it checks when you attempt to signup a new user name. They could write a loop to see if the new user name is !== an existing username as it loops through the array of existing usernames.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

   - Array methods help me manipulate an existing array to selectively add, subtract, replace, or rearrange elements.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

   - Loops save a lot of time, by using the power of a computer as opposed to manually typing everything out.
   - I would use a loop with an Array if I had an existing set of data that I needed to analyze.
   - I would loop without an array, if I need to create a dataset around certain parameters.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

   - Loops are a way to do a lot of work by following 3 simple rules, have a starting point, ending point, and how much you want to change by. Then you work your way from the starting point to the ending point while performing a simple task, or comparison until you reach the ending point.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

   - No questions in the context of what we have learned so far about loops and Arrays.
