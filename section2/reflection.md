## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

..* It's important to remember to not compare youself to others, but to compare yourself today to your past self and recognize how far you have come.
..* It was interesting to hear that some people burn out because there is still so more to learn and perhaps they have pushed themselves so far only to realize there is so much more to go.


2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

..* I've always enjoyed learning new things (I'm interested in) and never thought I had fixed abilities. Whenever I encounter something that I don't know, I'm curious and want to find out more about it.
..* In my previous line of work I had to create new unique solutions based on previous problems I had solved, by taking parts of those previous solutions and putting them together into a new one.

..* In ways I don't have a growth mindset are certain tasks or skills that I have no desire to get better at. I don't want to get better at packing a suitcase, swimming, mowing the lawn.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

..* Some things I had to run back and remember how to do, I can feel that you are already trying to "push me out of the nest" so that I can fly on my own.
..* It feels good, I'm only a few days into this and I am way far ahead of where I was just one week ago.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

..* A conditional statement is where something is evaluated and if the condition is met the next step begins, if not and alternate step can start or the sequence can end all together.  
..* An Example is on ebay when I place a bid, they have to check and make sure that I have submitted a bid higher than the current bid or else they tell me to bid higher!


5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

..* Else If statements can be added with a final else statement as a catchall for any unexpected values.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

..* I use the && to see if both conditions are met. || can be used to see if one of two conditions are met.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

..* I need to get better at brackets and notation and be perfect at it, because i know the devil is in the details.
