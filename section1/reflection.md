## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
..* I would say I tend to wait too late to ask questions, but in general I still make slow progress while working to my answers.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
..* String is text that can be stored in a variable.
..* Number is a numerical value that is stored.
..* Boolean, describes true or false values, perhaps used to compare things to determine if they are equal or if something is greater or less than something.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
..* console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
..* // or /* */   code comments are critical to describing your work and what each line does, when you come back in the future you
 don't want to have to struggle to figure out what was going on in the lines of code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
..* A variable is like a box, it holds what ever you put in it. You can change what ever you put it in.
When you want to see whats in your variable/box you just print it to the console!

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
..* Logging into my bank online, a variable of username and password would hold strings of text.
..* When I transfer money it would hold a variable of numbers.
..* When there are bank popups for a credit card I click no and that is maybe a boolean for false.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
..* Concatenation is like placing objects in a perfectly straight line. You start with things all over the place and concatenation puts them together in a nice neat line.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
..* Whatsapp, when it says "You have 8 unread messages". It is finding the number of unread messages and then concatenating it into a phrase that i can read.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
..* What are the rules surrounding semicolons at the end of a line??? ;; I'll do some googling on my own, but I need to get better about adding it to everyline.
